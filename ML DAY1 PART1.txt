Machine Learning Short Notes
_____________________________

*Supervised learning-learning based on classified examples and previous data(training data)


applications include speech recognition,patter recognition and information extraction etc.

*unsupervised learning- More like a set of algebra books given to a primary student(Data cnnot be categorised or labeled by the kid with his knowledge.Rather learn from various forms of data)

*Reinforcement learning- Semi-Supervised

_____________________________________________________________________

FEATURES
*********

An input variabe that determines the output.A Machine learning model can have more thanone feature.

LABEL
********
It is the thing that we are predicting more likely it can be called as the output.

NOTE:A LABELLED EXAMPLE WILL CONTAIN BOTH LABEL AND A FEATURE.

3.ML-MACHINE LEARNING

      |---REGRESSION				
SL----
      \---CLASSIFICATION

CLASSIFICATION-when the ouput variable is a category,such as RED BLUE 
	   (same definition as the author)


REGRESSION-when output variable is a definite value like weight mass price etc...

Classification doesnt give a clear ouput rather it classifies ..


LINEAR REGRESSION-METHOD FOR FINDIN STRAIGHT LINE OR HYPERPLANE(COPIED STRAIGHT FORM THE AUTHOR)
________________________________________________________________

y' = b + w1x1


Where,

y' is the label we are predicting.
b is the bias.(does the same thing what a constant c does to the line equation.Determines if to pass through origin or not)
w1 is the weight of feature 1. Weight is the same concept as the "slope" in the traditional equation of a line.
x1 is a feature (a known input).


EMPIRICAL RISK MINIMIZATION
_______________________________
	A model built by training the ML algorithm with labelled data sets..MORE likely to find a model that minimises risks and lowers the cost.


NOTE:LOSS IS THE PENALITY FOR A BAD PREDICTION

IF (MODEL PREDICTION IS TRUE )THEN,

{LOSS=0;}

ELSE

{LOSS>0;}
