#ML Day 2
#Basic brain functions I guess?
*Neurons In Brain
___________________
*communicate with each other in a unique way
*Basic working unit of the brain.

What is Machine Learning and Deep learning
____________________________________________

**Learning something from a data->Figuring out a way to beat the data->Getting better at it->A piece of cake...

**More coding and complex Math

#.Deep learning.#
________-_________

**A progressive slow learner if you could say that 
**More like a subset of Machine learning but way too powerful if you ask me..
**I ll take the authors example a flashlight having a deep learning model will eventuall learn to turn on with the cues "i cant see" or "the light switch wont work.

**Its a more brainy concept..Maybe try to learn it yourself..i dont know how to explain that concept..

**Its more like an updated version of machine learning,like more features are added to the previous version.. A more understanding model.

**WHAT IS A PERCEPTRON AND A NEURAL NETWORK
______________________________________________

*PERCEPTRON:A perceptron is used to figure out whether the ouputis 1 or 0

PERCEPTRONS are the Building blocks of Neural Network..
more precisely in a single-layered neural network the building blocks are perceptron.

A Neural Network or a group of perceptrons has 4 parts.

1.inputs and ouputs
2.weights and biasing
3.netsum
4.activation function

A NEURAL NETWORK-->>>>a complex logical statement...Just joking it is a high level logical statement but when we go deep into it we find out that its just a gropu of simple universal logic gates i.e AND ,OR ,NOT

IN A MULTI LAYERED NEURAL NETWORk , the output of the first layer i.e
the result given by the activation functions is passed on to the next layer perceptrons for further calculation of the results.

**WHAT IS OVERFITTING?**
__________________________

	Imagine that a student is given a training set which has lots of errors and mistakes (more likely noises and disturbances).He tries to learn it and at a point of time the student becomes an expert in that training set(HE ALSO LEARNS THE WRONG METHODS AND RECORDS THE NOISES THAT ARISE).

	when we give that student a test set he might give you a blunder of an  answer.This situation arose he was given more training with a set which has lots of noises.THIS SITUATON IS TERMED A OVERFITTING

## test loss >> training loss (OVERFITTING CONDITION)


KEY WORD
_________
FEATURE ENGINEERING- the process of converting raw data into feature vectors in ML is called as Feature engineering.

REGULARISATION-An importatnt feature in machine learning.Its a process which discourages the algorithm to lear much less from a data set inorder to reduce overfitting.
